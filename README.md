# System + Network Administrator Tool / Resource List
List of useful tools / software / scripts / resources for system and network administrators. Broken down into sub sections with corresponding links and descriptions. The idea behind the list is to share the tools I use on a daily basis, that make getting work done easier and more efficient. Link to script: https://github.com/samersultan/SysAdmin-Tool-List/blob/master/SysAdmin-Tool-List.md


This resource / list is a work in progress, I will be updating it regularly in the next coming months (every couple of days, as time allows). I hope that you find it useful, and thanks for taking the time to check it out.
